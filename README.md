Web application made to live test metaheuristic algorithm

WHAT IT CAN DO???? (at least in theory)
You open up a frontend application, choose a distinct algorithm with set parameters and test it on various functions.
Or, you can select a distinct function and test how different algorithms will perform

Algorithm creates raports so you can stop the algorithm, save the raport and load it up later. 

Backend:
Made with websockets to dynamically connect, start, terminate algorithms.
