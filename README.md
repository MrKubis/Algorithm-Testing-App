Web application made to live test metaheuristic algorithm

## WHAT IT CAN DO???? (at least in theory)
+ You open up a frontend application, choose a distinct algorithm with set parameters and test it on various functions.
+ You can select a distinct function and test how different algorithms will perform=
+ Algorithm creates raports so you can stop the algorithm, save the raport and load it up later. 

## BACKEND:
Made with websockets to dynamically connect, start, terminate algorithms.
